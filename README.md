## 🚀 Project Overview

This project integrates multiple DevOps tools and practices to build a fully automated pipeline for deploying a three-tier application. It leverages:
- 🐳 **Docker** for containerization
- ☸️ **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- 🏗️ **Terraform** for infrastructure as code (IaC)
- 🔧 **Jenkins** for CI/CD pipeline automation

### 📝 Recent Updates
- Environment variables added to Kubernetes deployments.
- CI/CD pipeline enhanced with automated testing using Jenkins.
- Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifest files updated for Minikube compatibility.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS CLI installed.
2. **Installation**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-el-mahdy/MCIT-DevOps-Project.git
   cd MCIT-DevOps-Project
   docker-compose up
      
### ☸️ Run with Minikube:
Ensure Minikube is installed and running, then apply the Kubernetes manifest files:
      
     kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/

## 🤖 Ansible Playbooks
This project utilizes Ansible for automating application deployments and configuration management. The playbooks are designed to:
- Install necessary packages.
- Configure application settings.
- Manage service states.

### How to Run Ansible Playbooks

-   Ensure you have Ansible installed and the inventory file set up with your target hosts.
-   
To execute an Ansible playbook, use the following command:
      ```bash
   
        ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml



## 🌱 Terraform
Terraform is used in this project to provision the AWS infrastructure. It allows for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), ensuring reproducibility and version control.

### Resources Provisioned
- **VPC**: Virtual Private Cloud for network isolation.
- **Subnets**: Configured for public and private access.
- **EC2 Instances**: For running applications and services.
- **RDS**: MySQL database instance for data storage.

###  Make sure you have Terraform installed and configured with your AWS credentials.

### How to Deploy with Terraform
1. Initialize Terraform:
      ```bash
      terraform init
2. Plan the deployment:
      ```bash
      terraform plan
1. Apply the changes:
      ```bash
      terraform apply




### 🧰 CI/CD Pipeline
The CI/CD pipeline, managed using **Jenkins**, automates the process from code commits to deployment. It includes:

- 🧹 **Code linting**
- 🧪 **Automated testing**
- 🏗️ **Container building**
- 🚀 **Deployment to a Kubernetes cluster**

### ☁️ Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Using **Terraform**, this project provisions the necessary AWS infrastructure:

- 🌐 **VPC**
- 🖧 **Subnets**
- 💻 **EC2 Instances**
- 🗄️ **RDS (MySQL) Database**

Ensure you have Terraform installed and configured to interact with AWS.
