MCIT DevOps Project - Kubernetes Manifests

This repository contains the Kubernetes manifests for deploying a multi-tier application as part of the MCIT DevOps Project. The project demonstrates how to automate infrastructure provisioning and application deployment using Kubernetes, Jenkins, Docker, Terraform, and Ansible. These YAML files define the key components needed for running the application on a Kubernetes cluster, including deployments, services, and ingress configurations.

The goal of the project is to showcase modern DevOps practices, such as CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, and infrastructure as code (IaC), by deploying an application in a scalable and reliable environment.

Key Features:

    Kubernetes: Manages containerized applications with automatic scaling and failover.
    Docker: Provides containerization for a consistent environment across all stages.
    Jenkins: Automates the CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment.
    Terraform: Provisions the required infrastructure on AWS, including EC2, RDS, and S3.
    Ansible: Manages configuration and ensures smooth deployment across the infrastructure.
